# Reproducible-Research-Project1  

This is the first peer-graded assignment in the Reproducible Research course on Coursera. This project analyzes a set of activity tracking data, and creates an R Markdown file to explain the analysis.
  
Dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip 
  
The variables included in this dataset are:  
- steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)  
- date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format  
- interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken  
  
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

## Analysis  
This project performs a series of analysis about the activity monitoring data:  
1. Loading and preprocessing the data  
2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?  
3. What is the average daily activity pattern? 
4. Imputing missing values
5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?  

## Files  

- PA1_template.Rmd: The R Markdown file created in R Studio that performs the analysis and annotates in text what the code does
- PA1_template.html: The HTML document that is identical to PA1_template.Rmd, but in HTML format and containing code outputs
